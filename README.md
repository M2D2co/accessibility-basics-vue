# Accessibility Basics - Vue

## Description

If you ever use the elevator, subtitles to watch that cat video during a boring meeting, or tabbed through a form, you have used an accessibility feature. As a community we understand that accessibility is necessary but when it comes to implementation, we often fall short.

This app is the base for a hands on workshop for those interested in learning how to get started.

## Getting Started

### Branches

* `latest` has the accessible version of the application.
* `start` has the starting point for the workshop. This branch includes errors that will be tested for, explained, and fixed during the workshop.

## Running the code

1. `$ npm install`: project setup
2. `$ npm start`: compile and hot reload for dev (serves the application on `localhost:8080`)

### Other scripts

* `$ npm run build`: compile and minify for production
* `$ npm run lint`: lint files

_Note:_ A modern browser is necessary to run this project

## Technologies Used

* CSS3 / SASS
* HTML5
* IndexedDb
* JavaScript ES6 syntax
* Vue
